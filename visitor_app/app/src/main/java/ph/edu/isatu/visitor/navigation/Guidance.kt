/**
 * Turns position readings into walking directions and spoken prompts toward one pin.

 *
 * - **Arrived** only when GPS places the visitor within the arrival distance (3 m by
 *   default) of the pin, from a reading accurate to 8 m or better, for three readings in a
 *   row, or when the visitor taps "I'm here". The GPS accuracy circle is never used as an
 *   arrival radius. Arrival is final for that target, so indoor GPS drift never restarts
 *   directions during a meeting.
 * - **Very close** when the pin is inside the reading's own uncertainty: the app says the
 *   office is within about that distance and asks the visitor to look for it.
 * - Distances are spoken only from readings accurate to 20 m: first the distance and side,
 *   then at 200, 100, 50, 25 ("just ahead"), and 10 m. Each is spoken once, never within
 *   6 s of another prompt. Readings worse than 50 m show a weak-signal notice.
 * - Outside the campus (past the server's 25 m allowance), directions pause and the
 *   visitor is warned once; coming back is acknowledged.
 * - With a [WalkingPath] along the walkways an administrator recorded, directions follow
 *   the path instead of a straight line: distances are walking distances, each turn is
 *   announced ahead ("In 20 meters, turn left") and at the turn ("Turn left now"), and
 *   wandering more than about 20 m off the path or walking the wrong way is pointed out.
 *   Arrival is still judged at the pin itself.
